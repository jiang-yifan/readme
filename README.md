Welcome to my Github,

In it, I have include my progress, learning to become a full-stack web developer. The main projects from those months of labor is DrawIt and can be viewed [live](http://drawit.herokuapp.com/) and a work in progress physics engine, Space Story. 

DrawIt uses Ruby on Rails as the back-end, Backbone.js for the front-end framework, and postgres for managing the database. It features completely custom CSS, which may have not been the best choice in terms of code maintainability, but it allowed me to skyrocket my understanding of CSS and what frameworks such as bootstrap has to offer.

Space Story will become a simulation of space travel and encounters. Currently, I have implemented the ability to represent circles as polygons allowing for a more diverse look to the simulation. The collision detection is implemented and will be used, in the future, to allow for dynamic breakage of the polygons based on the velocity of the impact, atom density, and point of impact.
